Hey Team\!

What we are experiencing is unprecedented. I am sharing some info regarding the Stay At Home Order and CAR's clarification on it, indicating **we are no longer able to physically show vacant or occupied property**.

However, there are still buyers and sellers that have need, and we still have options to help them. <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.carcovidupdates.org/stay-at-home-guidelines">Here's a link to CAR's post on the Stay At Home Order</a></u>.

Also, if any of you are feeling overwhelmed or discouraged, or you have other needs, please give me a call. Stay connected and stay encouraged\!

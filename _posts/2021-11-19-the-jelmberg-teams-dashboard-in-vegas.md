It’s that time of year again where we reflect on the year that was, celebrate with loved ones, and look forward to the year that will be. What excellent things could be in store for our relationships, business, and our lives in general? Business-wise, **now is the time we revisit the KPIs (key performance indicators) we set out to meet this year**, celebrate victories, study shortfalls, make adjustments, and set new, exciting goals for the coming year. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Our team started the festivities early this year. In late September, we went on a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate hitting a goal we set five years ago: $100 million in volume. We surpassed this goal in June. Watch the video above to see some footage from our lively trip and how much it meant to us to celebrate this exceptional milestone together. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This week, each of our agents will be solidifying their goals for next year. They are taking a hard look at what they want to achieve in their personal lives and what income from real estate they will need to accomplish them. From there **we will help them craft a business plan** with weekly, monthly, and quarterly actionable KPIs to ensure, at the end of next year, that we are celebrating again\! <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

We have two videos on how we approach goal setting included here that might be helpful as you look at what you would like to accomplish in 2022. Dream big\!

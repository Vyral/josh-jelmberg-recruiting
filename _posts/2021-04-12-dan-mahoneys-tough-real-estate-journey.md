I’m Dan Mahoney, and I’m here to tell you my story of overcoming challenging times as a real estate agent with the Jelmberg Team. I was a schoolteacher for a while, but that wasn’t the right career for me, and I worked in industrial sales from my 20s until my late 40s. **I’ve now been in the real estate business for almost 12 years**. I got licensed in 2009, which ended up being the perfect time to learn the business because I jumped into the deep end in one of the worst times in the real estate market. 2009 to 2011 were extremely difficult years for many people.

2020 began well, and I was on my way to having my largest sales volume ever, and then the pandemic hit. Not everything can be blamed on the coronavirus, but my business began to fall apart; I worked with plenty of people, but they weren’t pulling the trigger to buy or sell.

**Joining the Jelmberg Team was an entirely different ballgame**. It was invigorating because business wasn’t the same old, same old. I can now look forward to long-term financial and professional plans that I may not have been able to achieve as an individual agent. I was working with good people even as an individual agent, but it’s nothing compared to working with a team. With the support staff here, sometimes I’m still surprised when something’s already been done for me and I don’t have to worry about it.

The school of hard knocks is a great teacher, so **for agents just starting in the industry, give yourself some time to learn**. Make sure you have the financial resources to hack it for a while until things come to fruition and you’ve made the connections needed to do well. You might spin your wheels for a while with the wrong people, and some things you can’t learn from a book. You have to be hands-on and live through it.

If you ever have any questions about real estate or our team, reach out to the Jelmberg Team via phone or email. We would love to speak with you.

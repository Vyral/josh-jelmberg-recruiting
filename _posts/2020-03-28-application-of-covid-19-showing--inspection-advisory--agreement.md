All,

Please see the COVID-19 Showing / Inspection Advisory & Agreement. We are using this form as a "last resort" for:

**Buyers** that are adamant about getting in vacant or occupied property, after we have exhausted all our options for showing the property via pre-shot video, live virtual walkthroughs, etc.

**Sellers** that are adamant about having their property shown after we have exhausted all our options to get the property shown via pre-shot video, live virtual walkthroughs, etc.

**Contract to Close:**&nbsp;For inspectors, appraisers, walk throughs etc, after we have exhausted all options to adjust terms, closing and contingency dates, waiving VP's, drive-by appraisals etc., to accommodate for the governors stay at home order and social distancing.

We need to take KW in house councils recommendations seriously when he explains:

*"Please be advised that this isn't a "free pass" to get back to business as usual. This does not negate the fact that our E & O, nor any other insurance carrier, will cover any claims made against our firm or you related to COVID-19. This simply gives us a uniform way to document that anyone accessing our listings and/or conducting business has been advised of the risks."*

Call myself, Melissa, or Penny with any questions. Hope this reaches you well\!

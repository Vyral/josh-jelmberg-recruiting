Our team has seen exceptional growth over the past 12 months, and one of my favorite questions to get when meeting with any agent that is interested in our team is, “What’s your culture like?” I love hearing this question because it lets me know that the agent understands the impact that the culture of the organization they work with has on their career. Today I’ll be touching on how the culture of the team or broker you partner with can impact your business.

Regardless of the organization, when broken down in the simplest terms, strategy and culture are the drivers to success.

**Strategy provides clarity and focus for collective action and decision-making**. It relies on plans and sets of choices to mobilize people.

**Culture is the implicit social order of an organization**. It shapes attitudes and behaviors in wide-ranging and long-lasting ways. Cultural norms define what is encouraged, discouraged, accepted, or rejected within a group.

When our personal values, drives, and needs align with the culture of the broker or team we partner with, it can unleash tremendous amounts of energy toward a shared purpose and foster our capacity to thrive. We are more likely to enjoy work when our needs and values are consistent with an organization. If you work somewhere where the culture is a good fit, you'll tend to develop better relationships with coworkers and be more productive.

A good organizational culture will help unlock & maximize the potential in each of us. **I love these quotes on the subject:**

*“If we surround ourselves with people who are successful, who are forward-moving, who are positive, who are focused on producing results, who support us, it will challenge us to be more and do more and share more. If you can surround yourself with people who will never let you settle for less than you can be, you have the greatest gift that anyone can hope for.”* - Tony Robbins

*“Whatever you do in life, surround yourself with smart people who’ll argue with you.”* - John Wooden

*“It’s better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you’ll drift in that direction.”* - Warren Buffet

*“As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.”* - Proverbs 27:17

*“If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.”* - Confucius

At the Jelmberg Team, here is the vision of our owners, leaders, employees, and agents. We want to do things better than they have been done before. We work smart with great passion, enthusiasm & perseverance.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also believe in servant leadership. Leaders here lead by example, striving to add value to employees and agents in every interaction while walking with them on their journey to understand their purpose and achieving their personal and business goals.

This type of leadership builds trust and an environment where each individual on the team feels heard, is committed & accountable to their goals, the team’s goals, and each other. **The atmosphere is infectious, energetic, fun, and competitive\!** We love our work, and we love doing it together.

The results of this group speaks for themselves, as our average sales volume per agent is on pace to be over $10M (each) in 2021, with 40% of our agents pacing to close $15M, and 25% on pace to close over $20M in sales this year.<br>&nbsp;<br>If this sounds like a group you would like to surround yourself with, reach out for a private one-on-one meeting. I would love to help you.

<center><em>Renee Marrotte&rsquo;s experience in real estate and on our team.</em></center>

<br>Renee Marrotte has been an agent with the Jelmberg Team for some time now. I recently sat down with her to talk about her career and experience working with our team:

**Why did you get into real estate?**

I originally had been in college to become a physician’s assistant, but I didn’t quite make it through the rounds to get into the program because it was so impacted at the time I went.&nbsp;

The real estate market was going well, and my family had their own real estate company for many years. My mother needed help, so I decided to go to work in real estate. I took to it right away.

**When you first got into the industry, what was your vision for your business and your life?**

I always wanted to work in sales, but if you’ve ever worked in property management, you’d know that it takes a lot of time. Most of my time was occupied, and I couldn’t grow because all my energy was being spent on rentals. I needed to make a break so I could just concentrate on sales.

**How did you hear about us?**

I had been looking for a position, and I saw one of your advertisements, so I just applied.

**Having been with the team for a while, what can you do now that you didn’t feel comfortable doing before?**

I have more confidence in myself and what I can achieve. I’ve learned about many things like video calls and communicating better with different personalities.

If you have any questions about what it’s like to work on our team or what you could gain by joining us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to hear from you.

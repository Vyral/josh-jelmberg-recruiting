CAR has provided some forms for our buyers and sellers who want to physically see a property or have their property shown. By signing, buyers and sellers acknowledge the potential risk of having a physical showing. The <u><a target="_blank" href="https://pdfhost.io/v/EYtweo1Kw_Listing_Agreement_Coroavirus_Addendum_or_Amendment__420_ts05322pdf.pdf">Listing Agreement Addendum</a></u> gives the seller the option of who they deem acceptable to enter the property at all. See below for the appropriate situations these forms will need to be used and who will need to provide executed copies before a physical showing.

### **<u>PEAD</u>**

**Buyers and buyer agents** that are adamant about getting in vacant or occupied property, after we have exhausted all our options for showing the property via pre-shot video, live virtual walkthroughs, etc.

**Sellers** that are adamant about having their property shown after we have exhausted all our options to get the property shown via pre-shot video, live virtual walkthroughs, etc. Also, if a home is in escrow and an inspector/appraiser/contractor will be accessing the property.&nbsp;

**Contract to Close:** For inspectors, appraisers, contractors, walkthroughs, etc.

Please make sure you take a few minutes to read through <u><a target="_blank" href="https://pdfhost.io/v/XHkRfmHXz_Coronavirus_Property_Entry_Advisory_and_Declaration__420_ts19284_2pdf.pdf">this form</a></u> and understand the requirements to show property physically. Take note of paragraph four, section E, No. 5, indicating the requirements for PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) all parties are to wear when physically showing a home: shoe coverings, rubber gloves, mask, etc.

### <u><strong>Listing Agreement Coronavirus Addendum</strong>&nbsp;</u>

Mandatory for all listings.

### **<u>CAR Guidelines</u>**

In addition to these forms, CAR also released <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.carcovidupdates.org/best-practices-guidelines">Guidelines for Real Estate Best Practices During COVID-19</a></u>.

These guidelines require that we have read and understood the recommendations from the CDC on <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">how to protect yourself from the Virus</a></u>.

### **<u>Local COVID Update</u>**

Along the lines of protection, Riverside County also released a new public health recommendation to wear a face-covering in public (covering mouth and nose). Palm Springs recently made this recommendation mandatory. Face masks are difficult to come by, but pretty simple to make at home.

Watch: <u><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tPx1yqvJgf4">How to Make Your Own Face Covering</a></u>

Now is the time to take all precautions we can to keep ourselves and loved ones safe and healthy. As we discussed last week, cases in Riverside County are expected to spike towards the end of April or beginning of May. Our hope is, as a whole, our county and valley have taken the necessary steps in previous weeks and the coming weeks to significantly reduce the projected cases this model shows.

Lastly, keep in mind, our current ability to show property physically, could change if:

"A city or county in which you do your business activity has an order with a more restrictive standard regarding what qualifies as an essential service, or more restrictions on activities, those guidelines will still govern the activities of a licensee. In other words, if there is a more restrictive local order, it must still be followed. That order may prevent or limit your ability to conduct real estate activity."

Additionally, the City of LA has taken steps to <u><a target="_blank" href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/4/7/21206283/open-houses-los-angeles-coronavirus">suspended physical showings</a></u>.

We will keep you updated if there are any changes to this mandate locally.

### **<u>Team Needs</u>**

Also, there were some needs expressed in our meeting. As we venture out for groceries, let's make sure we are picking up:

* Toilet paper
* Paper towels
* Flower
* Yeast

Reach out to Melissa, Lorena, or myself if you have purchased some of these items for the group.

Have a great rest of your week and a happy Easter\! We have a lot to be thankful for\!

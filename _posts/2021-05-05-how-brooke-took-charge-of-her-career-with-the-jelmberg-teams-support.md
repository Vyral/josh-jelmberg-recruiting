My name is Brooke Baxley, and today I want to share the growth in my career that I have experienced since working with the Jelmberg Team.

After starting out with an escrow company I moved to a customer service position in a Title company. **I was working on getting my real estate license when someone from Keller Williams reached out to me** and suggested I work for them. At first, I said no, but three months later he reached out again saying they still wanted me.

At that point, I was in a stagnant place in my title career where I wasn’t able to move up. So I thought that if I became a real estate agent, I could control how much I made a bit more and how far I could move up in my career.

The Jelmberg Team allowed me to set my own goals. If I wanted to make X amount of money, the team helped me figure out what I needed to do to get there. **I’ve now reached the goals I originally set for myself.** It’s fun being on the Jelmberg Team, and that has everything to do with the people; our whole team is great.

I don’t know what I would have done with many different issues and deals if I didn’t have our team over the last couple of years. We get huge support that I’ve never had before in my career. My career has blossomed because of all these things added together.

If you ever have any questions concerning real estate, reach out to us. We would love to help you.

Regardless of where you are in your career, the key to seeing your business explode is focusing on the thing that probably drew you to real estate to begin with: **people.**

Creating trust with clients, negotiating offers, and providing amazing customer service not only help build relationships but are also key dollar-producing activities.

It sounds easy, but being a solo agent in today’s market requires you to wear a lot of hats, and they might not all fit. **Leveraging a highly trained and specialized transaction or listing coordinator may be your first order of business if you’re looking to grow your business.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Agents on our team have leveraged a team of contract managers, listing coordinators, and a marketing team that has been through well over 1,200 transactions together.&nbsp;

Once our agents get an agreement signed, the team handles it from there, with the agent only needing to get involved when there’s any kind of negotiation that needs to happen. Escrow, getting signatures, coordinating inspections, and keeping track of dates is all done for them.&nbsp;

Additionally, the marketing team ensures that listings are put on the MLS with amazing photos from our three in-house photographers who also provide 360-degree tours and drone shots as needed.

**The time saved utilizing these services alone allows our agents to spend 10 to 30 hours more per file with their clients.** Better service, happier clients, a greater understanding of market conditions, and consistent sales growth are all things that you can expect from incorporating these roles into your business.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about these services our team provides, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

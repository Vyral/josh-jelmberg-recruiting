I get questions from agents all the time about leads: What are your sources? How many do you get each month? How many do you provide your agents? I’m answering all these questions and more today.

**When we’re talking about lead sources, the key is to have multiple streams**. The marketing landscape is constantly changing, so to help insulate yourself from big swings in your business and income, multiple sources are key. Our team has a full-time marketing specialist that is constantly working to ensure we are invested in the lead sources with the highest ROI.

As far as the lead sources we currently invest in, **we focus most of our ad spending on content creation, paid search, and social media, while also strategically investing in print and direct mail**. Also, to make sure we're at the forefront of lead generation, we take a portion of our ad budget each year to explore new and different lead sources and marketing strategies.

**All of these efforts are driving over 25,000 unique visitors to our website each month and producing over 700 leads each month**. Though we commit to 30 leads per month for each of our agents, they're actually getting quite a bit more than that. This doesn’t even factor in the sphere and prospecting leads that we teach our agents to produce on their own and that they get a higher split for.

As a team, about 50% of our sales come from sphere and prospecting leads, and 50% come from leads we provide. Our leads are split right down the middle with buyers and sellers. Even though the market is competitive for buyers, there is still a great opportunity for business out there by prospecting for them. Our team has already put 117 buyers into escrow this year. If you’re struggling with that part of the market right now, check out [<u>our recent video</u>](https://www.jelmbergteam.com/blog/make-stronger-offers-with-less-stress){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to increase your chances of getting your buyer to escrow.

If you can show your value to a client in this climate, they’ll stay with you until the market loosens up and you can find them the right property. If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
